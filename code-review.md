    # Code Review: Inv-Alert Android Application

    As the first step in my capstone project, I conducted a professional code review of an existing artifact: the "Inv-Alert" Android application. The goal of this review was to identify strengths and weaknesses in key areas of computer science and to formulate a plan for meaningful enhancements.

    This analysis served as the blueprint for the improvements made to the application's security, data structures, and overall software design.
